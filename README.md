PanicAlarm
==========

A windows phone 8 application , intended for use in emergency medical/physical assault conditions, where it sends messages to people from contact list , and publish location with emergency type on facebook , just with one press of a button. Created during Microsoft.Code.Fun.Do  , this app was selected for second round by the Microsoft guys !! 


And Did I tell you , I never knew c# before , learnt it in 24 hours, came up with an idea, and coded it up to get to second round with Sneh Vyas, Arnav and Chandan.
